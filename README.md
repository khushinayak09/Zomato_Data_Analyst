# Zomato Data Analysis
Hey there! We're diving into the world of Zomato data analysis using Python and its handy libraries. <br>
Let's take a look at some of the key tools we'll be using:<br>

<b>- Numpy:</b> This library helps us crunch numbers and handle large calculations with ease.<br>
<b>- Matplotlib:</b> It's the go-to for creating awesome plots, charts, and more.<br>
<b>- Pandas:</b> This one makes working with data frames a breeze and lets us perform multiple analysis tasks in one go.<br>
<b>- Seaborn:</b> For creating visually appealing and informative statistical graphics.<br>

You can tackle this analysis using Google Colab Notebook or Jupyter Notebook to make things easier.<br>

<b>We've got some interesting questions to explore, such as:</b>
1. Do more restaurants offer online delivery or offline services?
2. Which types of restaurants are the most popular with the public?
3. What price range do couples prefer for their restaurant dinners?
